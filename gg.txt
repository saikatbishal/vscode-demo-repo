I know the moon. I know its desires to be something ordinary. I khow it through the shabby, black skies. I know its love for Anaxogore. The moon and I feel just the same. To be just and ordinary. There are things that the moon knows and whispers to me in sleepless nights. It feels pain and heat. It listens to the music of clouds. It feels the despair of never meeting the sun yet feeling the heat.
